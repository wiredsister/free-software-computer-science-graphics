A free software repository of infographics and visualizations for understanding Computer Science ideas.

1. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
2. Binary Trees
3. Routing Schemes
4. Virtual Memory Management
5. A Binary to Hex to Decimal Conversion Chart
6. An Overview of a Compiler

## Current exported formats: 
- [x] png
- [x] pdf
- [ ] jpg
- [ ] gif
- [ ] svg

_it's pretty trivial to support whatever image format you need_

## How do I request a visualization? 
Post an issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/wiredsister/free-software-computer-science-graphics/issues) and be descriptive about what you'd like it to look like and whom the target audience is. Apply the label `Request` and someone will respond and work with you on prototyping.

## One of the visualizations is incorrect! 
Please create an issue, fill out what exactly is wrong, and label it `Bug`. If the response time is slow, feel free to reach out on twitter [@wiredsis](https://twitter.com/wiredsis). Also, a nice way to contribute would be to review visualizations and create Bug tickets.

## Can I add my visualization? 
Yes! As long as you're cool with people being able to copy and distribute these graphics. I'm using illustrator but gimp would be ideal.

## Can I add some visualization from my text book, friend's blog, etc?
Maybe? Check their permissions and licensing around the art. Ideally, _they_ should be posting it here. 

## Todo: 
- [ ] font licenses
- [ ] converting source .ai files to have text outlines not fonts
